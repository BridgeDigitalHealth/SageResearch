/**
 `SRSStep` is the base protocol for the steps that can compose a task for presentation
 using an `SRSTaskController`. Each `SRSStep` object represents one logical piece of data
 entry, information or activity in a larger task.
 
 There are two base implementations included in this SDK. `SRSTaskStep` is used to define 
 a subgrouping of steps such as a section in a longer survey. `SRSUIStep` is used to define
 a display step. Depending upon the display device, more than one `SRSUIStep` might be shown
 on a given page. For example, a section of a survey may display multiple fields on an iPad
 whereas each question in the survey is shown on a new page for an iPhone.
 
 A step can be a question, an active test, or a simple instruction. An `SRSStep`
 subclass is usually paired with an `SRSStepController` that controls the actions of the step.

     A short string that uniquely identifies the step within the task. The identifier is reproduced 
     in the results of a step history.
     
     In some cases, it can be useful to link the step identifier to a unique identifier in a
     database; in other cases, it can make sense to make the identifier human
     readable.
