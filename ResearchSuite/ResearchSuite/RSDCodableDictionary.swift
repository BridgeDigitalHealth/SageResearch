/**
 Work-around for a `Codable Dictionary` that does not use a String as it's key.
 
 See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44725202/swift-4-decodable-dictionary-with-enum-as-key
 
 Example usage:
 
 ````
 enum AnEnum : String, CodingKey {
     case enumValue
 }
 
 struct AStruct: Codable {
 
     let dictionary: [AnEnum: String]
 
     private enum CodingKeys : CodingKey {
         case dictionary
     }
 
     init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
         let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
         dictionary = try container.decode(CodableDictionary.self, forKey: .dictionary).decoded
     }
 
     func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
         var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
         try container.encode(CodableDictionary(dictionary), forKey: .dictionary)
     }
 }
 ````
 */
public struct RSDCodableDictionary<Key : Hashable, Value : Codable> : Codable where Key : CodingKey {
    
    let decoded: [Key: Value]
    
    init(_ decoded: [Key: Value]) {
        self.decoded = decoded
    }
    
    public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: Key.self)
        
        decoded = Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues:
            try container.allKeys.lazy.map {
                (key: $0, value: try container.decode(Value.self, forKey: $0))
            }
        )
    }
    
    public func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: Key.self)
        
        for (key, value) in decoded {
            try container.encode(value, forKey: key)
        }
    }
}
