/// `RSDLengthFormatter` is a custom subclass of the `NSLengthFormatter` that can convert a `NSMeasurement`
/// object to a localized string.
///
/// The default converters are overriden to check for a `NSMeasurement` and return the converted string
/// if available. If the units are imperial for the current locale, this is for measuring the height
/// of a person, *and* the value is below the `heightLowerThreshold`, then the measurement
/// will be returned in inches rather than in feet and inches.
///
/// - note: While this SDK is written in Swift where permissibile, formatters are written in Obj-c to allow
/// overriding `-getObjectValue:forString:errorDescription:`. Apple documentation does not include how to
/// set the value of the pointer for a Swift 4 implementation of the function. syoung 12/30/2017

/// Is this formatter used to describe a child's height? The default behavior for `NSLengthFormatter`

/// if it is for an infant or child. Whereas, typically a US height for infants and children is shown
/// in inches only. This property, if set to `true` will return a child's height in inches unless
/// the locale is metric, in which case it is ignored.
///
/// - note: Setting this value to `true` will also set `isForPersonHeightUse` to `true`.

/// centimeters and the default imperial unit (US English) is inches. Otherwise, the default metric
/// unit is meters and the default imperial unit is feet.
