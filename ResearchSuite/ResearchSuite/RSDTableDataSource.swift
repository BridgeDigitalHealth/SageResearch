/// `RSDTableDataSource`: the internal model for a table view controller. It provides the

/// are valid, and retrieving specific model objects that may be needed by the view controller.

/// The tableView data source is comprised of 2 objects:
///
/// 1. `RSDTableSection`: An object representing a section in the tableView. It has one or more

///
/// 2. `RSDTableItem`: An object representing a specific table cell. There will be one `RSDTableItem` for
///     each indexPath in the tableView.
///
/// 3. `RSDTableItemGroup`: An object representing a specific question supplied by `RSDStep` as an input
///     field. Upon init(), the ItemGroup will create one or more `RSDTableItem` objects representing the
///     answer options for the `RSDInputField`. The ItemGroup is responsible for storing/computing the
