/**
 `RSDStep` is the base protocol for the steps that can compose a task for presentation using a controller appropriate to the device and applicaytion. Each `RSDStep` object represents one logical piece of data entry, information, or activity in a larger task.
 
 There are two base implementations included in this SDK. `RSDTaskStep` is used to define a subgrouping of steps such as a section in a longer survey. `RSDUIStep` is used to define a display step. Depending upon the display device, more than one `RSDUIStep` might be shown on a given page. For example, a section of a survey may display multiple fields on an iPad whereas each question in the survey is shown on a new page for an iPhone.
 
 A step can be a question, an active test, or a simple instruction. An `RSDStep` subclass is usually paired with an `RSDStepController` that controls the actions of the step.
